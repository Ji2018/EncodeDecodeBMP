# EncodeDecodeBMP
 Encrypt an image in BMP format using a customized encoding way and then decrypt it using an internal function.


1. Enable Encoding function:
   
   Input for Main ( String path_of_raw_image, String path_of_txt ) to encode the text into image and store as .*_encoded.bmp

 -> If no input is provided, will use test file test_unencoded.bmp and test.txt for encoding purpose by default

2. Enable Decoding function:
   
   Input for Main ( String path_of_encoded_image, "") to decode the content

-> \"" is any String input whatever

3. Other files:

test.txt and test_unencoded.bmp <- text and unencoded images for the default encoding purpose.
encoded.bmp <- This is the image that had been encoded with letters.
